This folder is for JPG advertisement images.

To add ads:
1. Create satirical JPG banner ads (800x200 px recommended)
2. Save them in this folder with descriptive names like:
   - skipline-pro.jpg
   - queue-anxiety-pills.jpg
   - gaming-chair-supreme.jpg
   - premium-queue-pass.jpg
   etc.

The ad system will automatically detect and rotate through any JPG files placed here.

If no images are found, the system falls back to text-based ads.
